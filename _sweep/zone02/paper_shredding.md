## Why This

## Getting Started

* Buy a cross cutting shredder. Or a micro cut shredder.
* If dealing with a big back log, consider a service. Unless you're seriously a target the bin at the UPS store should be just fine, but there are other services you'd just be more comfortable witnessing the shredding yourself.
* If you have binders and notebooks, STAPLES offers a service which will take care of large amounts of bulky items (priced by weight of items): 
>Per Staples: Shred papers, envelopes, file folders and spiral-bound notebooks. 
>Documents can be as is, no need to remove paper clips or staples

## Maintenance mode

* If things have your name and address on them, shred it. If that seems too much, at least do financial docs.
